# Quantum _k_-nearest neighbour algorithm

Python code for quantum k-nearest neighbour algorithm devised by Afham, Afrad and Dr. Sandeep K. Goyal. This code can be used to replicate the results of classical kNN on the problem of entanglement classification, given in the paper "Quantum k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm".

Please consider citing our paper if you wish to use the code.
